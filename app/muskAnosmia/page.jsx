      <p>
        Have you ever tried a fragrance that other people say is amazing, but
        you think it smells awful like a wet ashtray, or it smells like nothing
        at all? You may have musk anosmia like me. I have done a lot of personal
        research on this, and here is what I have found...
      </p>

      <p>
        Musk anosmia is a genetic condition where the person is unable to
        perceive musk. There aren't a lot of studies about it, but they estimate
        that at least 7% of people have it. Because of the size of musk
        molecules, if a fragrance contains musk, I am unable to perceive it AND
        any of the other notes in that fragrance. The exception is sandalwood.
        If the fragrance contains sandalwood then that is all I smell, and it is
        VERY strong. It comes off smelling like a sharp wet ashtray. Without
        musk, the sandalwood is more subdued so it smells nice.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many types of musk, and most fragrances contain one or more of
        them. The human olfactory receptor OR5AN1 is sensitive to macrocyclic
        and nitro musks (muscone, civetone, habanolide, ambrettolide), but not
        polycyclic (galaxolide, fixolide, tonalide) or alicyclic musks. Someone
        with a genetic variant in OR5AN1 will likely experience musk anosmia
        when exposed to polycyclic or alicyclic musks. I've found that once my
        musk anosmia is triggered, all fragrances will smell like nothing, unless
        they contain sandalwood, in which case they will smell like wet ashtray.
        To clear this temporary anosmia, I can move into clear air and sniff
        peppermint, cloves, or tea tree oil for 10 minutes. Then my olfactory
        senses are 'reset'.

      <p>
        Some fragrances that I can't smell are Swiss Arabian Musk Malakai, Initio
        Musk Therapy, LaPerla Invisible Touch, LaPerla Once Upon a Garden,
        Xerjoff Damarose (this one broke my heart), and Baccarat Rouge 540.
        Fragrances that smell like wet ashtray to me always contain musk and
        sandalwood, like Molinard Habanita and Nishane Ani.

        , the presence of musk can change the intensity of the perception of some
        notes, which is why fragrances containing musk and sandalwood will smell
        like only sandalwood, and the sandalwood is intense so it smells like wet
        ashtray.

        In summary, OR5AN1 is a crucial macrocyclic and nitro musk receptor in
        humans, and genetic variation appears to cause variable responsiveness
        to macrocyclic musks in in vitro assay. Significant differences were
        observed among OR5AN1 genotypes in musk odor perception; genetic
        variation of OR5AN1 affects the perceived intensity of exaltolide and
        ethylene brassylate, and the detection threshold for muscone.
